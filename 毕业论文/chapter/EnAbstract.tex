This design aims to address the problem of detecting the presence of tempered glass on a production line by developing a highly stable, flexible, and versatile ultrasonic proximity sensor. The sensor has a detection range of 100mm to 200mm with an accuracy of 1mm.\par
Compared to traditional MCU control, this design uses a CPLD chip to control the TUSS4470 integrated circuit, providing higher precision pulse signals. Additionally, the design can adjust the number of pulses emitted per transmission based on different materials and detection ranges to obtain higher quality echo signals. Furthermore, the design employs a detection strategy that uses multiple pulse transmissions and sets a detection threshold for the number of detections to determine the detection status. The number of pulse transmissions per cycle and the detection threshold can be adjusted according to different application scenarios, thereby improving the flexibility and reliability of the sensor.\par
This article will provide a detailed description of the hardware design, software design, and experimental design aspects of the ultrasonic proximity sensor. After completing the hardware and software design, the sensor will be physically assembled and tested using an oscilloscope to debug the program. Finally, an experimental plan will be developed to test the sensor's performance parameters, detection strategy feasibility, and echo characteristics.
