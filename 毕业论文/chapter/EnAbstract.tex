    In the automation production, the stability and accuracy of the in-place sensor play a very important role. This graduation project plans to develop and design an ultrasonic proximity sensor based on the TUSS4470 integrated chip, mainly used for in-place detection in the tempered glass automation production line. Compared with traditional single-chip control, this design uses a CPLD chip to generate sensor drive control signals, obtaining drive signals with higher precision and stability than traditional control signals.\par
    The hardware design of the sensor includes CPLD minimum system design, TUSS4470 chip peripheral circuit design, and PCB design. The software design includes chip configuration, pulse generation, and in-place detection. This design adopts a detection strategy of sending multiple pulse waves and setting the detection threshold to judge the detection status. The number of pulse emissions and pulses can be adjusted according to the application scenario, greatly improving the flexibility and reliability of the sensor in production application.\par
    The experiment shows that the sensor can detect objects in the range of $100mm$ to $200mm$ with a detection accuracy of up to $1mm$ and a detection cycle of $10ms$. This design has achieved the expected goals and has the characteristics of good stability, high accuracy, and rich application scenarios.
